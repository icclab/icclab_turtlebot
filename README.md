# icclab_turtlebot

Clone this branch on your local machine (not the robot) to view turtlebot operation, and to test launch files/scripts in simulation with Gazebo.

Execute the command below to view turtlebot operation (e.g. exploration with gmapping, navigation with amcl)
`````
roslaunch icclab_turtlebot view_remote_turtlebot_navigation.launch
`````

For further documentation please [see here](./docs/).

**NOTE:** This branch has not been very well maintained. Launch files, scripts, and documentation may be outdated and require updates.
